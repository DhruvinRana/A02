# Part 1: Tutorial on setting up git/webstorm/github

1. Set up Git 

Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. To set up Git, you will need to download and install the latest version of the software.Once Git is installed, you will need to configure it for your user account. You can do this by running the command “git config --global user.name <your_name>” and “git config --global user.email <your_email>” in the terminal. 

2. Set up Webstorm 

Webstorm is an integrated development environment (IDE) for web development. To set up Webstorm, you will first need to download the latest version of the software. Once downloaded, you will need to install and configure the IDE. Once Webstorm is installed, you will need to configure your project settings. This includes selecting the version control system (Git) and setting up the project’s working directory. 

3. Set up Github 

Github is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. To set up Github, you will need to register for an account and create a repository. Once your repository is set up, you will need to link it to your local Git repository. This is done by running the command “git remote add origin <repository_url>” in the terminal. Once the remote repository is set up, you can push your local changes to it by running the command “git push -u origin master”. This will upload all of your changes to the remote repository. You can then view the changes on the Github website. These steps will help you get started with setting up Git, Webstorm, and Github.
